1
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:37,010
You, you guys!

2
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:38,644
Devon!

3
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:41,618
Devon is... re... re... re...

4
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:44,080
retiring!

5
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:47,877
Ah! Ha! Ha! Ha!

6
00:00:47,993 --> 00:00:48,877
Who the hell is Devon?

7
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:50,156
Wha... wha... wha... aw.

8
00:00:50,157 --> 00:00:51,233
Who the--?

9
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,118
He's our mailman.

10
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:59,429
The only man who's delivered mail to this house for my entire life.

11
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:03,300
His shorts were always the harbinger of summer!

12
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:05,762
Aw! Haw-haw-haw-haw-haw.

13
00:01:05,955 --> 00:01:09,359
I could kill you right now. Weren't you supposed to quit crying for New Year's?

14
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,724
Aw! Haw-haw, my--

15
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,474
I'm sensitive!

16
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:14,910
It's a desirable trait in some cultures.

17
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:17,412
In France, maybe-- Oh, my God! Move to France!

18
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:19,724
Go the hell to France!

19
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:22,857
Stan, you were supposed to give up yelling for New Year's.

20
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:25,318
But I love yelling. It feels good and it's good for you.

21
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:27,241
That's why Sam Kinison lived so long.

22
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,991
I swear to God, you two.

23
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:33,626
Uh, Mom? Weren't you supposed to give up smoking?

24
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:34,357
Ah!

25
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:37,645
Yeah, well, you were supposed to give up junk food.

26
00:01:39,824 --> 00:01:41,786
Ah, it's Okay, Mrs. S.

27
00:01:41,859 --> 00:01:44,417
And you were supposed to give up hugs!

28
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:47,343
Is it such a flaw that I want to hug everyone I see?

29
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:49,445
If you're not a Special Olympian, then yes.

30
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,931
Ugh. This family sucks.

31
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:54,681
We never do anything we say we're gonna do.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,726
Just look at the popsicle stick White House we started 6 years ago.

33
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,863
*

34
00:02:01,158 --> 00:02:02,908
Mmm, popsicles.

35
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,491
Hey, let's all quit our jobs and buy an ice cream truck.

36
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:07,392
Just drive around, making kids happy.

37
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,622
- That's a great idea!
- We are totally doing this!

38
00:02:09,623 --> 00:02:10,584
I'm a kid!

39
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:12,855
I'll Google it tomorrow, see what a truck would cost.

40
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,889
Or maybe the next day. Tomorrow's kind of busy.

41
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:18,130
Gosh, it sounds really complicated. You know what? We tried. Let's just forget it.

42
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:19,628
- Yeah, I don't really care.
- I don't know...

43
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,981
- what we were thinking.
- Yeah, good idea, not a good idea.

44
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:25,753
Mardi Gras, bitches! I'm having a party at my bar.

45
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:29,205
I got beads aplenty, so I want to see all your tatas!

46
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:33,699
Except you, Hayley. You have the worst boobs. The-they're like 90% nips.

47
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,564
Like 2 dark castles with tiny little moats.

48
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,980
Mardi Gras.

49
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:44,192
That means Lent starts tomorrow!

50
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:46,703
This is our chance to give up our vices again!

51
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:48,004
What the hell is Lent?

52
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,010
Lent is the period between Mardi Gras and Easter.

53
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:53,857
It's a time of prayer and introspection.

54
00:02:53,972 --> 00:03:00,875
People give up things for the 40 days of Lent to get closer to God or... remember Jesus' sacrifice.

55
00:03:00,918 --> 00:03:05,530
# No-no-no-no-no-no-no! No-no-no-no-no-no! No-no-no-no! #

56
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:05,934
Bbb!

57
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:09,870
I don't appreciate you tainting my booby holiday with God stuff.

58
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:15,793
Come on, guys. What do you say? Let's give it another try for Lent.

59
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,668
No yelling. No crying. No junk food. No hugs.

60
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,302
And I'll quit smoking.

61
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,686
And we'll really follow through this time.

62
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:26,225
- I don't know.
- Too hard.

63
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:27,955
- Not into it.
- I do what she says.

64
00:03:28,132 --> 00:03:29,709
Okay, fine.

65
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:35,709
If you do this, I'll... let everyone get pee-in-their-pants drunk at Roger's Mardi Gras.

66
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:36,863
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

67
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:39,173
Let's get in line so we're the first ones there!

68
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,529
Deputy Director Bullock? What are you doing here?

69
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,959
Are you kidding me? I hear this is the best party of the year.

70
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,383
What the hell, Avery? You didn't save my place? I've been waiting with you for, like, 3 days.

71
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:53,464
When you went off to get your Frito Pie, I had time to think.

72
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:55,810
And my thought was... I hate you.

73
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,444
Treme! Etouffee! Beignet! You're gay!

74
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,779
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

75
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,890
Last chance to get our vices out.

76
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:08,168
Aw! Haw-haw-haw-haw-haw-haw!

77
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,121
Oh, I'm gonna miss crying so much.

78
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,435
Am I drunk? What's in this cake?

79
00:04:13,436 --> 00:04:15,428
Rum! It's also in this needle.

80
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:19,120
Ah! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

81
00:04:19,804 --> 00:04:22,856
Another shot! The Prince of Mardi Gras demands it!

82
00:04:22,857 --> 00:04:25,202
Aah! I'm yelling!

83
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,488
So do you and Greg plan to give up butt play for Lent?

84
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,217
Um, we don't consider that a vice. It's an act of love.

85
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:36,510
Ah, well, there's the difference then. I'm giving it up for sure.

86
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,624
- Oo-ho-ho!
- I fell in love last night, Klaus.

87
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:50,720
Tell me everything. No! Tell me the highlights.

88
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:52,047
It was magical.

89
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:54,605
She had breasts like I've never seen before.

90
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,910
We danced all night, but when midnight came, she ran off before I could get her name.

91
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,363
You were smashed, man. You kept high-fiving that black guy. He was not into it.

92
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:08,680
Klaus, this pastie.

93
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,932
It's hers. She was wearing it!

94
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:15,306
The most perfect bosom I've ever seen wore this pastie last night!

95
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:21,471
I have to find the booby that fits this pastie so I can spend the rest of my life happily ever after with its owner.

96
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,393
Ooh, maybe she'll have a friend.

97
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:28,064
Yeah, and I'm sure she'll want to get with a fish. Look, you got to start being more realistic, Okay?

98
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:31,055
Now grab your heralding trumpet and meet me in the pumpkin carriage.

99
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:34,365
*

100
00:05:35,077 --> 00:05:36,654
I don't feel that hung over.

101
00:05:36,943 --> 00:05:39,346
Guess I can handle my alcohol better than you guys.

102
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:40,500
Oh, yeah?

103
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,116
Pubic hair... and mayonnaise ice cream.

104
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:45,932
Bwagh!

105
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:53,040
Hey! That guy... that guy's gonna get a piece of my mind.

106
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,328
He's got glasses. I'm gonna call him a nerd.

107
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:56,809
- Gonna start with that--
- Stan!

108
00:05:56,905 --> 00:05:59,195
Remember, you're giving up yelling for Lent.

109
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:04,964
Look. We're doing this and we're all gonna stick with it this time. Right, guys?

110
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:06,257
Bleah!

111
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,753
Whoa, look at that?

112
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:11,388
- Whoa--
- Whoa--

113
00:06:14,638 --> 00:06:17,081
American Dad cares.

114
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:17,571
*

115
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:23,365
Francine, maybe we'll all just give up making you happy for Lent. Would that make you happy?

116
00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:26,744
Smiths! Good Lent to you! How are the sacrifices going?

117
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:28,389
Yeah, it turns out we're gonna blow that off.

118
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,658
Hmm. I'm afraid that wouldn't be in your best interest.

119
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:35,676
You made a deal with me last night to make sure I help you follow through.

120
00:06:35,704 --> 00:06:41,097
Like you give a rat's ass what anyone does. You-you've stolen babies and sold them to underground dinner clubs.

121
00:06:41,122 --> 00:06:44,014
How dare you! That was pillow talk!

122
00:06:44,465 --> 00:06:53,870
Oh, I'll admit it. I'm a degenerate. I love drugs and drinking and gambling, and my moral compass always points south.

123
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,856
Yeah!

124
00:06:55,953 --> 00:06:59,286
But during Lent I repent and that makes up for the rest of the year.

125
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:04,761
This year my Lenten promise is making sure you keep your Lenten promises.

126
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:07,230
You all agreed. You signed a contract.

127
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:08,751
Wha-what contract?

128
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:10,675
Ah, yes, you were quite drunk.

129
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:15,174
I was afraid you may not remember, so I documented everything.

130
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:19,801
While this loads, did you guys ever think of this?

131
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:23,763
Sylvester Stallone's name... is Sylvester.

132
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:31,170
- # Habet Bullock cultro. Si non sequitur meo per votum... #
- # Habet Bullock cultro. Si non sequitur meo per votum... #

133
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:34,882
- My man! Up top! My dog!
- # ego. Lenten anathema seseque di-- #

134
00:07:35,594 --> 00:07:41,191
That contract you signed says I get to cut off a finger of the first person who cracks.

135
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:44,923
You're full of it. You're not really going to cut off anyone's finger?

136
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:48,281
Ew, gross!

137
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:51,628
Yes. I started collecting when I was in Vietnam.

138
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:53,070
2 summers ago.

139
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,326
I was on a sex tour. Did not get laid. Had 0 game.

140
00:07:57,423 --> 00:08:00,173
Just kept... cutting off fingers.

141
00:08:06,134 --> 00:08:07,692
You want to cut off our fingers?!

142
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:08,894
1 finger.

143
00:08:09,036 --> 00:08:12,722
The finger of the first person who doesn't keep their Lenten promise.

144
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,048
- I hope it's the boy.
- Why?!

145
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:16,875
I envy your youth!

146
00:08:17,377 --> 00:08:20,435
Hey, hey, come on. This a good thing.

147
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:23,916
This is our chance to finally follow through on something.

148
00:08:24,108 --> 00:08:27,833
And now there are real consequences if someone slips up.

149
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,680
I've installed cameras all over your house to track your every move.

150
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:38,555
And not to worry, Francine. There are no minicameras in your tampons, so...

151
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:40,286
all good to go there.

152
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:54,175
Make way for the Prince of Mardi Gras!

153
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:59,472
My good man, I'm looking for the maiden who fits this pastie so I may maketh her my wife.

154
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,125
Uh-huh.

155
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,664
None of my girls wear anything like this.

156
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:08,787
But there is 1 stripper here who may be able to help you. She's been in the business for decades.

157
00:09:08,788 --> 00:09:11,864
Ooh, she's wise as ass.

158
00:09:18,076 --> 00:09:21,480
Fair one. It is rumored you know of all things stripper.

159
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:27,204
This is not the pastie of a stripper.

160
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:28,973
It's handmade.

161
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:33,399
This pastie belonged to a civilian.

162
00:09:33,713 --> 00:09:35,020
Thank you, wise one.

163
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,484
A hay-penny for your troubles.

164
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:48,400
Plinko!

165
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,342
Ah, nothing like a nice movie night to take our minds off Lent, huh, gang?

166
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:01,156
Let's see what we got...

167
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,637
Oh, Lucas!

168
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:03,983
Nope, that'll make me cry.

169
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,598
Okay. Field of Dreams.

170
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:07,541
No way. Hits too close to home.

171
00:10:07,906 --> 00:10:09,503
I was never close to my father.

172
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:16,176
Do you have to eat that junk food right in front of my face?

173
00:10:16,177 --> 00:10:17,929
I need it so I don't smoke.

174
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:18,929
Nope.

175
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:20,141
Nope.

176
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:22,715
Steve? Please, kindly...

177
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:29,282
please find a movie and stop flipping channels before I wring the last breath out of your very, very, very annoying body.

178
00:10:29,283 --> 00:10:30,688
Thank you very much. Thanks.

179
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,748
I can't be near that popcorn. Just get it out of my face!

180
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:40,761
Well done, Hayley! Throw out the temptation.

181
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:42,635
Throw out the devil in all of you.

182
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,308
Mr. Bullock, sir! Please, let us off the hook!

183
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:53,370
I know it's difficult, young man. Of course, if you'd rather I just take a finger from one of you, that will satisfy our contract.

184
00:10:55,001 --> 00:11:01,371
Oh, and I was watching the shower cam. Jeff, quick question. Why do you only shave your left goose egg?

185
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:04,731
I'm doing it now too, and I want to know the reason why.

186
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:13,507
Okay, Mrs. Simmons, if you'll step away from the mammogram machine, I have 1 more important test.

187
00:11:13,558 --> 00:11:14,212
Ah!

188
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:17,731
All right, sir, I said you could try 3 nipples and then you'd have to go.

189
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:18,385
Fine.

190
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,866
But as long as I'm here.

191
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:24,886
Your... breasts are full of spiders!

192
00:11:24,982 --> 00:11:26,770
Perfect! That's the way I like 'em.

193
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,419
Hey, how's Daddy's little trooper?

194
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:33,842
This sucks, Dad.

195
00:11:33,843 --> 00:11:34,919
I know, kiddo.

196
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:38,978
Listen, I get that this is hard for you, but you're such a sweet, good boy.

197
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:42,016
That's why I want you to let Bullock take your finger.

198
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:42,553
What?!

199
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:45,993
You heard him. As soon as he gets his finger, he'll leave, and we'll all be off the hook.

200
00:11:46,262 --> 00:11:48,300
So just give up and let him have your finger...

201
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:49,185
for me.

202
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:50,357
For Papa.

203
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:53,250
- Forget it, man.
- Okay, we're at an impasse.

204
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:56,732
But someone in this house has to crack and give Bullock their finger...

205
00:11:56,742 --> 00:12:00,537
because not being able to yell is giving me very tiny hard poops.

206
00:12:00,576 --> 00:12:01,942
Babe, where's my hat?

207
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,346
You're wearing it.

208
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:07,553
Of course, the moron!

209
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:08,846
The moron.

210
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,262
Jeff.

211
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,656
Mr. S.

212
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:18,848
Jeff.

213
00:12:19,266 --> 00:12:20,422
Jeffrey.

214
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:24,249
I don't think I tell you enough how honored I am to have you in my family.

215
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:25,004
Really?

216
00:12:25,038 --> 00:12:28,877
I just wish there was some physical way I could express our familial closeness.

217
00:12:28,942 --> 00:12:30,400
Oh, Mr. S!

218
00:12:30,554 --> 00:12:32,445
I love you, Jeff Fischer.

219
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:34,249
Meet love halfway, Jeff.

220
00:12:35,211 --> 00:12:37,287
Babe, no! You're in pre-hug!

221
00:12:38,076 --> 00:12:39,846
They're trying to sabotage you!

222
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:41,838
Well, two can play at that game.

223
00:12:42,588 --> 00:12:45,658
Obama has done amazing things with health care.

224
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:49,024
Soon our medical system will be as good as Canada's.

225
00:12:49,025 --> 00:12:49,743
U-- Huh!

226
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:55,483
# It's been 7 hours and 15 days #

227
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,424
No!

228
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:59,693
# Since you took your love away #

229
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:03,003
The saddest song ever! Dad, help!

230
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,520
Hang on, son! I'm coming!

231
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:10,981
- # I go out every night and sleep all day #
- # I go out every night and sleep all day #

232
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:11,836
Traitor!

233
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:15,336
- # Since you took your love away #
- # Since you took your love away #

234
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:16,581
# But nothing-- #

235
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,707
- # I said nothing #
- That's right, Steve. Your father betrayed you.

236
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,131
- # can take away-- #
- Hurts, don't it?

237
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,542
- # these blues #
- Let it out, buddy. Jeff, Steve's about to go down.

238
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:28,291
- # 'Cause nothing compares #
- # 'Cause nothing compares #

239
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:29,618
- # Nothing-- #
- # Nothing-- #

240
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:31,933
- # compares 2 U #
- Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!

241
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,792
Can't hear, won't cry! Can't hear, won't cry!

242
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:35,617
What the hell is going on in here?!

243
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:37,214
They're trying to make me break!

244
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:39,887
What is wrong with you people?!

245
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:42,933
Lent is only 37 more days.

246
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:44,145
- Aw!
- Aw!

247
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:50,583
Ugh. People are stressing me out, and I can't smoke, so I'm gonna go sit on the dryer and think about Stamos.

248
00:13:53,184 --> 00:13:54,511
What are we gonna do, Dad?

249
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:56,260
I don't think we can make it.

250
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:58,952
We'll be fine. Besides, what's the worst that could happen?

251
00:14:01,692 --> 00:14:04,634
Hey gang, I'm-- Holy moly!

252
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:10,741
*

253
00:14:15,537 --> 00:14:18,287
I ju-just wanted us to be a good family.

254
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:21,499
Sorry, I... didn't mean to make it sound like I was blaming you.

255
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,326
Ha-ha! Gotcha!

256
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:36,306
I don't understand.

257
00:14:36,325 --> 00:14:40,472
Trickery! Steve's guts? A simple garden hose covered in hot sauce!

258
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:43,309
What?! Why would you do that?!

259
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,494
So you'd break, and we could end all this.

260
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:48,609
After all, it was you who dragged us into this in the first place.

261
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:52,763
Oh, did I miss a hot sauce and hose party?

262
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,570
Aw! Francine! Are you smoking?!

263
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,080
Looks like I'm cutting off your finger.

264
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:02,769
Just 1 finger from whoever cracked first. That was the deal, right?

265
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:03,696
Right-o!

266
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,280
Heh! We're free!

267
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:09,514
So good.

268
00:15:09,668 --> 00:15:11,426
Ah-ha-haw-ho-ho!

269
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:13,983
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ho-ho-ho!

270
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:16,234
Stop flipping channels yesterday!

271
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:20,012
Aw! Ho! Haw! Haw! Haw!

272
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,882
So, Francine, which finger shall I take?

273
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,590
This one.

274
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:28,917
Ooh, that is a hard burn on you, Smiths.

275
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:41,892
All right then, I'm off to the kitchen to set up the ceremony, and then we'll chop your pinky off in 2 shakes.

276
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,074
Francine, you're shaking like a leaf.

277
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,728
Do you not want to do this?

278
00:15:49,343 --> 00:15:51,670
It's Okay. I have a plan to get you out of here.

279
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:53,767
We're not gonna let Bullock cut off your finger.

280
00:15:54,017 --> 00:15:54,978
Okay, huddle up.

281
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,536
Okay, here's the plan.

282
00:15:57,632 --> 00:16:00,612
We peel out of the driveway, hit the freeway and head for the border.

283
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,401
But hold on, Francine. Here comes Bullock.

284
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:04,401
Oh, man, he's in a Lamborghini.

285
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,632
Jeff, toss me the Uzi.

286
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,920
Oh, no, I forgot it.

287
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,323
You idiot! Then we'll have to lose him.

288
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:11,246
I'm gonna drive straight into the mall!

289
00:16:11,247 --> 00:16:12,881
Not through the puppy store!

290
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:16,804
Stop! Stan, I'm not running away from this.

291
00:16:16,805 --> 00:16:17,611
Mwa?

292
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:23,905
We made a promise to Bullock. And for once in our lives, we're going to be a family that follows through!

293
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:25,886
I'm letting him take my finger.

294
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:33,334
I got to warn you guys. I get real faint at the sight of blood.

295
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:37,265
What?! You?! No!

296
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,063
Have you ever seen a sad prince, Klaus?

297
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:47,744
- Well, Prince Charles was pretty devastated when--
- I'm the saddest prince there is...

298
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:50,256
because I cannot find my true love.

299
00:16:51,173 --> 00:16:52,096
But hark!

300
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:55,096
Upon what hopeful vision does my royal gaze fall?

301
00:16:59,723 --> 00:17:03,550
Klaus, my liege. It appears we may be nearing the end of our quest.

302
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:06,629
I can't stop thinking about those spiders in your boobies.

303
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:16,702
Good sir, 'tis I, the Prince of Mardi Gras.

304
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:19,260
Be there any fair maidens in this cottage?

305
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:20,567
Why, yes, indeed.

306
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:25,127
I have 3 uniquely-breasted daughters, and they all went to your Mardi Gras ball.

307
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:28,769
The prince is here... to see all the bosoms in the house!

308
00:17:28,932 --> 00:17:31,471
- Oh! The prince!
- Oh! He's here!

309
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:33,701
Father, Father, try my bitty first.

310
00:17:33,702 --> 00:17:34,997
No, mine. Try mine.

311
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:36,646
It'll fit me. I just know it.

312
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:58,132
But the crest and the fairy tale cottage.

313
00:17:58,305 --> 00:18:00,959
Are you sure there are not any other maidens in the house?

314
00:18:01,126 --> 00:18:04,933
Well, I do have a stepdaughter, but... it couldn't possibly be her.

315
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:07,298
She was not permitted to go to the party.

316
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,029
She was busy doing chores.

317
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:17,232
Oh, my God.

318
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,790
Now I remember. It's you!

319
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,329
You're the girl of my dreams!

320
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:23,194
Uh!

321
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:39,611
I wish we could live inside this song forever.

322
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:47,473
I did it, daughters.

323
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:50,704
I married her off. And to a prince, no less.

324
00:18:53,579 --> 00:18:56,598
We're just gonna let that guy and his fish take our cow?

325
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,753
Are you ready, Francine, to pay for your sins?

326
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,811
I am.

327
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:16,464
Francine, you have broken your contract with God.

328
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:21,675
Your family was true to their word, so fully-fingered they shall remain.

329
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:23,323
Oh-ho-ho.

330
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,669
Oh. Oh-ho-ho-ho.

331
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:29,130
Francine, you are weak. You are a failure.

332
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:31,290
You are... the very worst.

333
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:34,859
No! She's innocent! Take my finger instead!

334
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,734
No, I'm the worst! Take mine!

335
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:38,003
Take my whole hand!

336
00:19:38,004 --> 00:19:39,753
Take my hairy right goose egg!

337
00:19:40,868 --> 00:19:42,685
My God.

338
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:49,386
Smiths, what a heroic display! A family coming together to save their matriarch.

339
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:52,425
This sacrifice is the true spirit of Lent.

340
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,771
I hereby absolve you from any further sacrifice.

341
00:19:59,085 --> 00:20:00,123
- Aw.
- Ah.

342
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:01,969
- Huh.
- Ah.

343
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:07,018
Well, I get to keep my finger, but we broke another promise.

344
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,604
- Ah!
- Ah!

345
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:11,478
Francine, you were right.

346
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:15,353
We promised a finger, and for once, this family is following through.

347
00:20:16,488 --> 00:20:18,315
Well, down to 7 fingers.

348
00:20:18,353 --> 00:20:20,488
Oh, Stan! We did it!

349
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:22,488
We finally don't suck.

350
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:23,931
I love you.

351
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:26,489
Let me tourniquet that, Mr. S.

352
00:20:26,796 --> 00:20:27,700
Mmm!

353
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:33,879
And so, Smiths, you have truly seen the message of Lent...

354
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:38,912
and that is, if you want to please God, give up something for 40 days...

355
00:20:38,913 --> 00:20:45,379
or cut off a finger, then go right back to drinking, cursing, pillaging, raping, and doing cocaine.

356
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,877
My work here is done!

357
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,485
I built this in your house.

358
00:21:31,471 --> 00:21:33,298
Bye, have a beautiful time!
